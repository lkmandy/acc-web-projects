          <td>HTML/CSS</td>
          <td>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) are two of the core technologies for
            building Web pages. HTML provides the structure of the page and CSS the visual layout. Along with graphics
            and scripting languages, HTML and CSS are the basis of building Web pages and Web Applications now and in
            the near future. You might use these two technologies to create an online portfolio of your work to display
            and share with others on the web.</td>

          <td>C#</td>
          <td>C# is a multi-paradigm, statically-typed programming language with object-oriented, declarative,
            functional, generic, lazy, integrated querying features and type inference.</td>

        <tr>
          <td>GO</td>
          <td>Fans of Go (called gophers) describe Go as having the expressiveness of dynamic languages like Python or
            Ruby, with the performance of compiled languages like C or C++.

            The language is open source, and was started by engineers at Google. It's written using a C-style syntax,
            has statically typed variables, manages memory using garbage collection, and is compiled into stand-alone
            executables.

            Go is noted for the concurrent programming features built into the language core, the networking packages in
            the standard library (such as a web server), fast compilation and execution speed. Its simple, minimalistic
            and consistent language design make for a delightful experience, while the abundant and thoughtful tooling
            addresses traditional problems such as consistent formatting and documentation..</td>
